# Write a code to accept the name of a person as input and print the initials as output.
#  Assume that the name will be of this form: <first name> <last name> . 
# Also assume that the first name and last name will be a single word, and there will be exactly one space between the two

# names. For example, if the input is Rohit Sharma, the output should be RS.

name = input("Enter the Name :")
a=name.split(" ")
fop=""

for s in a:
    fop+= s[0].upper()+" "
print(fop)


#solution
