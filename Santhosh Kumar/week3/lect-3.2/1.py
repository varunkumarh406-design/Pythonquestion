## Introduction to While Loop

# Ask the question for the first time and store the input
year = int(input("When did India get its independence (year)? "))

# Start the while loop: repeat as long as the year is NOT 1947
while year != 1947:
    print("Come on, don't you know even this?")
    print("That's okay, I will let you attempt this once more.")
    
    # Prompt for input again inside the loop
    year = int(input("When did India get its independence? "))

# Once the loop condition (year != 1947) becomes False,
# this code executes, which means the answer must be 1947.
print("Hip Hip Hurray. You got that right!")
