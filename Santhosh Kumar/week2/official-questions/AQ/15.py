# On what day of the week were you born? If you don't know the answer to this, use the calendar library to get the answer.

import datetime

# Take birth date input
year = int(input("Enter birth year (YYYY): "))
month = int(input("Enter birth month (MM): "))
day = int(input("Enter birth day (DD): "))

# Create date object
birth_date = datetime.date(year, month, day)

# Get day of the week
day_of_week = birth_date.strftime("%A")

print("You were born on a", day_of_week)


#solution
import calendar
year = int(input("Enter birth year (YYYY): "))
month = int(input("Enter birth month (MM): "))
day = int(input("Enter birth day (DD): "))
day_index = calendar.weekday(year, month, day)
day_name = calendar.day_name[day_index]
print("You were born on a", day_name)
